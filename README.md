This repository contains Database Management System (DBMS) laboratory work implemented using Oracle Database 21c and MySQL. The objective of this lab work is to build strong practical understanding of relational databases by applying theoretical DBMS concepts through structured SQL experiments.

The repository helps students learn how databases are designed, managed, and queried in both enterprise and open-source environments. Oracle Database 21c is used to explore advanced, industry-level features, while MySQL provides hands-on experience with a widely adopted open-source database system.

Key Features--

Database and table creation using SQL
DDL, DML, DCL, and TCL commands
Constraints: PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL
SQL queries using SELECT, JOIN, and SUBQUERIES
Aggregate functions with GROUP BY and HAVING
Views and indexes

Basic PL/SQL in Oracle 21c

All SQL scripts are organized in a clear folder structure for easy execution and understanding. This repository serves as a practical reference for DBMS students and helps bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world database applications.
